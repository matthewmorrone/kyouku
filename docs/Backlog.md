# Backlog

## Known bugs
- [ ] Spacing on the left edge for ruby persistent overhang
- [ ] Distribute spacing better for multikanji ruby headwords 
- [ ] when combining or splitting words, dictionary popup shows no result until refreshed

## Dictionary issues
- [x] wouldn't it make more sense if example sentences were grouped by meaning/sense used?
- [x] in the example sentences, the corresponding English word should be highlighted too
- [x] leverage embeddings in deciding whether to include example sentences, shouldn’t just be by string matching 
- [x] lots of redundancy on word detail view
- [ ] deduplicate example sentences
- [ ] custom reading popup should be prefilled and set to japanese keyboard
- [ ] provide meaning of verbs in the form they surface in 

## Performance / UX issues
- [ ] Make saving to the words list more responsive 
- [ ] Clicking the star button doesn’t always trigger bookmarking, but the bookmark button always does
- [ ] typing freely in english in the paste area is super laggy

## Ideas
- [x] add option to change displayed font for Japanese
- [x] add a toggle for distinguishing kanji, hiragana and katakana (maybe with font?)
- [x] add a toggle for highlighting distinct parts of speech
- [ ] quiz on next and previous words/lines
- [ ] Romaji 
- [ ] List conjugations
- [ ] Spaced repetition for flashcards
- [ ] Auto clipboard paste/search
- [x] Check if OCR is built in to iOS
- [ ] Kanji data
- [ ] Handwriting input and kanji stroke order 
- [ ] kanji of the day feature with pretty images
- [ ] Implement the action plan in `docs/KaraokeAlignmentImprovements.md`
docs/KaraokeAlignmentImprovements.md for Higher-quality, more granular karaoke alignment improvements
